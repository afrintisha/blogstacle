description: "CTO, dev/sysadmin, homelab enthusiast—and occasional victim of a scolding cat."
---

Hello there! I’m **Afrin**—developer, sysadmin, and Chief Technology Officer at [Lewsion](https://lewsion.com). I built this blog to share my hard-earned knowledge (and occasional face-plants) while documenting my own learning journey. If you’ve ever wondered how many times one can type the wrong subnet mask before going mad, you’ve come to the right place.

## My Day Job

- 🔧 **CTO @ Lewsion**: I wrangle servers, code, and sometimes people (in the nicest possible way).  
- 💻 **Dev & Sysadmin**: I live at the intersection of “It builds on my machine” and “Why is production down?”

## Why This Blog Exists

1. **Knowledge Sharing**  
   I believe in the power of open knowledge—if my misadventures can save you an hour of Googling, I’ve done my job.
2. **Personal Journal**  
   Tracking what I learn keeps me honest. Plus, it’s fun to look back and ask, “What was I thinking?”  
3. **FOSS & Privacy Vibes**  
   Self-hosting everything isn’t just a flex—it’s about privacy, control, and the warm fuzzies of running your own stack.

## My Favorite Toys

- **Docker** & **Proxmox**: Containerization and virtualization—because one level of abstraction is never enough.  
- **Nano** (yes, really) and **VS Code**: For the days I can’t remember `vim ~/.bashrc`.  
- **MikroTik** & **Tailscale**: Networking gear that keeps my homelab talking (and sometimes screaming).  

## Meet Bandittoh 🐱

When I’m deep in debugging, there’s always one more voice of reason: my cat, **Bandittoh**. He:

- Mews encouragingly when I spin up a new VM.  
- Scolds me—literally—when I commit “just one more typo” to production.  
- Keeps my caffeine intake in check by walking across my keyboard at 3 AM.  

## Tone in This Corner of the Internet

You’ll find my posts to be **professional** (mostly), with a dash of **sarcasm**, and the occasional **over-serious rant**—because if you can’t have fun while breaking things, what’s the point?

Thanks for stopping by. Pull up a chair (or an empty rack), and let’s get building.
